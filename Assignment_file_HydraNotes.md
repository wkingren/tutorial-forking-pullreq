## Introduction
![The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51q8N-KuaeL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)
1. The Atlantic is a hotbed of migration; migration related to labor classes: pirates, sailors and immigrants.
2. The use of the Hydra myth, by the ruling class or elites, presents an easy to understand representation of anti-progress as embodied within labor classes (as seen, not by the authors, but by the elites captured within the examined historical documents).
3. The various labor classes did not always, as will be examined, work hand-in-hand with one another, but at times fought with or sidetracked one another within the greater scheme of things - again, the use they many-headed hydra, where some heads might fight one another, is useful imagery.
4. Though not consistently obvious, the Hercules aspect of the myth is not be lost.  This monograph is very much a story about labor classes as it is the ruling / elite classes within the Atlantic world.

## Chapter 1: Wreck of the Sea-Venture
![The Wreck of the Sea Venture by Christopher Grimes](https://minerdescent.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/wreck-of-the-sea-venture-2.jpg)
* This chapter lays the foundations of the ideas of freedom from enclosure the author use of the story about the shipwrecked crew of the Sea Venture in the Bermuda islands in 1609 and William Shakespeare's Version of the story, _The Tempest_.
* The stories tell of the origins of capitalism and colonization through world trade and the building of empires that caused the uprooting of peoples and perpetuated the spreading of the desire for the old communes and the use of violence to stamp out the rebellions.
* There are 4 major themes in the origins and development of the English Atlantic
	1. Expropriation: The transformation of land and labor into commodities. The enclosing of the commons led to the need to resettle "The Swarms of Idle Persons"  With the formation of the Virginia Company in 1606, England began to take over the Atlantic and used their ships as locations for and forms of transportation for the idle swarms (p 15-16).
	2. Alternative Ways of Life: The desire of many of the shipwrecked people and some of those who later made it to Virginia was to live a life of leisure. They wanted a society that were antinomian, anarchist, pacifist, egalitarian, and hunter and gather.  A return to the commons is what lead many to rebel and run away to live with the Native Americans who still lived in similar societies.  
	3. Patterns of Cooperation and Resistance: People of different backgrounds and professions working together for profit and or survival, such as the crew and passengers working together to try and save the ship during the Hurricane.  Also when the officials of the Virginia Company organized labor to build new ships to reach Virginia. The motley crews that formed in rebellion and stayed on the Island.  The resistance that continued once they reached Virginia and Thomas Gates' efforts to enforce the law and retain his men in Jamestown.
	4. Imposition of Class Discipline: "Terror created boundaries" (p 35). Ship and sailor were essential to the creation and growth of the English Atlantic and new laws and harsh punishments were put in place as instruments of control.  Just after finally reaching Virginia Thomas Gates put in place new laws; 37 articles with the purpose of military labor, keeping settlers apart from the Native Americans and deterring challenges to his rule.
* "Military men transformed Bermuda and Virginia from places of 'liberty and the fullness of sensuality' to places of bondage, war, scarcity, and famine" (p 35).

## Chapter 2: Hewers of Wood and Drawers of Water
* *More emphasis on violence and terror: Foucault. Discipline, forcing people to become something.*
* **The Curse of Labor**
	* Continuance of “the analysis…of the processes of expropriation, exploitation, and colonization” (40).
	* Wide use of the term, describing the “invisible, anonymous, and forgotten, even though they transformed the face of the earth by building the infrastructure of ‘civilization’” (42).
* **The Labors of the Hewer and Drawer**
	* “Three main functions: they undertook the labors of expropriation [clearing land, building infrastructure]; they built the ports and the ships and provided the seafarers for Atlantic commerce; and they daily maintained the households” (43).  They made the rise of merchant capitalism possible.
* **Terror**
	* “In England, the expropriation of the peasantry was accompanied by systematic violence and terror, organized through the criminal sanction, public searches, the prisons, martial law, capital punishment, banishment, forced labor, and colonization” (49).  Very severe, very public.  Measures of control.
* The Specter of Hercules
	* Targets of the “holy war”: 1. Caliban (Natives)  2. Canannite (dispossessed commoner)  3. Pirates  4. Land rovers, petty thieves, highway robbers (underclass who rejected wage labor)  5. Assassins (threat to kings)  6. Amazons (empowered women)  7. Anabaptists
	
## Chapter 3: "A Blackymore Maide Named Francis"

## Chapter 4: The Divarication of the Putney Debates
* In this chapter, Rediker and Linebaugh establish that England is the origin of both the Commons and Slavery throughout the Atlantic.
* The debates between the common soldiers off the New Model Army and Oliver Cromwell's representatives encapsulated a microsom of Atlantic revolution.
* Putney was a crossroads in England, and both commonism (freedom) and slavery (enclosure) flowed accross the Atlantic World to Naples, London, Ireland, Barbados, The River Gambia, and Virginia
>*Tribeless, landless, nameless,*
*Wealthless, hostless, fameless*
*Wander now thine aimless*
*Children to and fro.* (p 123)

## Chapter 5: Hydrarchy: Sailors, Pirates and the Maritime State

* This chapter looks at the wooden world of the 18th century and argues that the ship was both the key component for expanding capitalism and the setting for resistance against this capitalist system. The majority of the concepts in this book can be seen in greater detail in _Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea:Merchant Seamen, Pirates, and the Anglo-American Maritime -world, 1700-1750_ by Marcus Rediker.
* The authors contend that in the last half of the 17th century capitalist organized the exploitation of human labor in four ways.  
1. The commercial estate for the capitalist production of agriculture.
2. The production of petty goods that use to be the market sector for artisans.
3. The putting-out system, which saw a circulation of goods to Africa and the Americas from Europe.
4. The mode of production that united the previous three, namely the ship.
* Yet this ship , while vital to carry on the triangular trade, also created a collective group that resisted at every opportunity. For example, Linebaugh and Rediker argue that Jack Tar was always seen at the forefront whenever there was a riot, mutiny, or piracy.
* Such militancy against the capitalist world resulted in the wooden world being "turned upside down" with the rise in piracy during what is known as "The Golden Age of Piracy". The authors maintain that a pirate ship turned the capitalist world upside down as it was an egalitarian society  that practiced true democracy.
* This does give the reader pause. It may be true that pirate crews often voted on matters such as prizes taken, and officers of the crew. This was, however not always the case and depended on each ship. It could also be argued that pirates where part of this capitalist system as they were trying to increase their profits with as little work as possible. Recent historians of the Golden Age of Piracy such as Ed Fox makes these assertions and argues that Rediker's interpretation of the Golden Age is flawed when it comes to the egalitarian nature of the pirate ship.

## Chapter 6: "The Outcasts of the Nations of the Earth"
1. Chapter Thesis: There was a conspiracy that involved the proletariat of the entire Atlantic, and it erupted in the 1741 New York rebellion.
2. p. 183, the "Gangs of New York" organize into a paramilitary operation, with multiple captains reporting to the same commanders.
3. p. 184-186, West Africans, paricularly Gold Coast Africans, were committed members of the plot, organized into their own groups with their own leaders.
4. p. 186-188, Irish involvement (around 30-35 men) in the conspiracy reflects their troubled economic and political troubles with the English.
5. p. 188-190, Cuban "negroes and mulattoes," captured as a prize and treated as slaves, were particularly aggrieved because they were free Spanish subjects.

## Chapter 7: A Motley Crew in the American Revolution
![Boston Stamp Act Riot 1764](https://i2.wp.com/allthingsliberty.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/stamp-act-riot.jpg)

* In chapter seven of _The Many-Headed Hydra_ Linebaugh and Rediker describe the make up of the working class people in the American Revolution. The authors argue that the people who helped to spread the idea of independence was not the elites of society, but a motley crew of working class people.
* Linebaugh and Rediker state that two meanings of "motley crew" must be defined.
1. The first definition refers to an organized gang of workers.
2. The Second definition is the sociopolitical formation of the port or town.
* Combined, these definitions demonstrates the dynamic of the motley crew of the American Revolution which was a multi-ethnic collective that was composed of both sailors and slaves who fought together against the stamp acts and impressment. Both groups created a mob which increased in size as other working class peoples joined in.
* Sailors and slaves were prime movers in the cycle of rebellion because they were part of a migratory pattern that could carry word of  rebellions from other parts of the empire to North America.
* In the picture above many members of the motley crew can be identified which includes a sailor, a slave, a woman, a craftsman, and perhaps a farmer.
* The elites of society, however, did not agree with this radical bottom up vision of the nation and intervened. The elites were able to take control of the revolution, and after the battles had been won, were able to subjugate the motley crew back into its "desired" social statues.
